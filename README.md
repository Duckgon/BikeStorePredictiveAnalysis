# BikeStorePredictiveAnalysis
 
## User Guide

1.	Make sure these programs are installed before running the application
*	Anaconda 3
*	Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12
*	Python 3.11
*	Sci-kit learn (python module)*
*	Numpy (python module)*
*	Pandas (python module)*
*	Matplotlib (python module)*
(NOTE: All the python modules should be installed automatically if Anaconda 3 is installed. If that is not the case, you may need to manually install them through windows command prompt)
2.	Make sure you have the files downloaded from the WGU assignment
3.	Open up Anaconda 3 and launch Jupyter

4.	Locate the file you downloaded and launch ‘app.ipynb’

5.	After you launch the application, you can add in the variables and the machine learning model would predict the likely jersey size they will buy. The first paramenter input is the age of the customer, and the second parameter input is the gender of the customer.
*	If you want to predict a 34 year old male, you would type ‘model.predict([[34,0]])’ under user input.
*	If you want to predict a 70 year old female, you would type ‘model.predict([[70,1]])’ under user input
*	Press ‘Shift + Enter’ to show the output.

6.	You can view the bar chart describing the customer demographic by pressing ‘Shift + Enter’ under the 2nd and 3rd code block.

7.	To test the accuracy of the machine learning model, you can execute (Shift + Enter) the ‘Accuracy test’ block code, and it will display how accurate the model is. (The closer to 1, the more accurate the model is)

## Summation of Learning Experience

Machine learning and data analytics has been a topic I have been studying for several months now. My academic experience with SQL Server has allowed me to filter out the necessary data from kaggle.com. I have also used this tutorial https://youtu.be/7eh4d6sabA0?t=2 to help download the softwares and modules needed for this project. 
I would also say that the ‘Data Strucutres and Algorithms 2’ and the ‘Software Quality Assurance’ classes helped me tremendously in this project. ‘Data Structures and Algorithms 2’ has solidifed my skill in coding comfortably in python, while ‘Software Quality Assurance’ has taught me the proper terminology used to write this document.
By working on this project, I have learned many lessons. I was able to apply my data analysis skills for SQL as well as implementing my communication skills. Trying to communicate in a non-technical and technical way is a cruical skill in the workplace, and I am glad I was able to exercise this skill. I also learned how to utilize outside resources such as kaggle, google, and youtube. I will use these new found skills and apply them in my career as a data analyst in the future.
